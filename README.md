Explanation of the Code:

HTML (index.html):
Sets up the basic page structure.
Includes a div with class background-shapes for the dynamic animated shapes that contribute to the "dynamic" frosted glass effect.
A div with class container to hold the main content.
A div with id frosted-glass which will have the frosted glass effect applied to it and will contain the countdown and button.
Elements for the countdown timer (#countdown).
The "Subscribe" button (#subscribeBtn) and a message area (#subscribeMsg).
CSS (style.css):
Background:
body has a base pink gradient.
.background-shapes div: Creates several divs that are animated (pulsating and moving) to give a dynamic feel to the background. These will be blurred by the backdrop-filter on the content.
Frosted Glass Effect:
.frosted-glass: This is the key.
background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);: A very light, semi-transparent white background for the glass effect. Adjust alpha (0.1) for more or less transparency.
backdrop-filter: blur(10px);: This is what creates the blurriness of the content behind it (the animated shapes).
box-shadow and border-radius for a softer look.
Countdown Timer & Button:
Basic styling for the timer text and the button.
#subscribeMsg is initially hidden.
Random Text Pop-ups:
.popup-text: Styles the floating text (color, shadow, animation).
fadeOutUp: A CSS animation to make the text fade and move up.
JavaScript (script.js):
Countdown Timer:
Sets the targetDate.
setInterval updates the countdown every second.
Calculates days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining.
Displays the time or a "Happy 520!" message if the date has passed.
Subscription Button:
Adds an event listener to the button.
On click, it changes the button text to "Subscribed!" and displays the success message. It also disables the button to prevent multiple "subscriptions."
Important: This is a front-end simulation. No actual email subscription or backend processing is happening.
Random Text Pop-ups:
popWords: An array of your desired phrases.
Adds an event listener to the document.
On click:
Creates a new div for the popup text.
Randomly selects a word from popWords.
Sets the text and styles it.
Positions the text near the mouse click.
Appends it to the body.
Uses setTimeout to remove the popup after a short duration to create the disappearing effect.
